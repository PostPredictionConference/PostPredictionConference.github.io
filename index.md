  <h3>About</h3>
  <p> <b>Post-Prediction Conference</b> is community-organised conference focused
  on the present and future impacts of AI.
  </p>
  <p> Machine learning is becoming evermore capable at predicting our futures.
  This ability is being used to alter our actions and behavior. As the
  machine learning and AI community, how will we respond?
  </p>
  <p> This conference is about understanding and exploring how we will design and
  direct AI in this new world; a world where prediction is arbitrarily good â€”
  the "post-prediction" world.
  </p>
  <p> We're interested in building a community around understand how we
  should design AI systems that integrate well with our human,
  environmental, social and cultural practices.
